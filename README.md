Edge-guided denosing convolutional neural networks(EDCNN) is  based  on modifications to the Denoising Convolutional Neural Networks(DnCNN) and Image Restoration  Convolutional Neural Networks (IRCNN). DnCNN and IRCNN can achieve good performance for blind-level noise removal tasks in synthetic images. To make these two CNNs perform better for ultrasound images, we involve edge information during the learning so that better edge preservation can be achieved during noise removal.

The orgininal source code of DnCNN and IRCNN can be found at: https://github.com/cszn/KAIR.
